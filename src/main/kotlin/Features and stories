1: Multiply 2 random numbers in a range determined by complexity based on user input
    1.1: Create a function to get user input
    1.2: Determine numbers' range (upper limit) based on 1.1
    1.3: Generate 2 random numbers in using 1.2 amd print them
    1.4: Get user input on product of numbers in 1.3
    1.5: Compare user input against real mathematical product
    1.6: Print output
    1.7: Calculate and print score instead of just 1.6
    1.8: Loop infinitely until user aborts

2: Sum-Product of chain of single-digit numbers
    2.1: Create a function to get user input for complexity (=length of chain)
